#Mai's Cradle

A repurposed old project of mine. I'm now planning on using it to host some of my ai projects.

#Back in development! 

I am now using SWIG to create a c++ dll for the bullet physics engine. That should take care of my physics problems.

#Running

You'll need to download [Love2d](https://love2d.org/)

Then, right now the game should just work when you run love. If it doesn't, please send me a message.

Pinkie Pie sprites are currently being used for testing. (You wouldn't *believe* how hard it is to find 8-directional isometric sprites with jumping animations! I couldn't even find commercial alternatives.) They should not be included in any release.
